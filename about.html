            <h2>Rowan Raskin is a non-binary artist exploring queer narratives of family and perceptions of the body through the use of story telling and glass making. Rowan attempts to replicate the human experience in a form that is comprehensible for audiences of all backgrounds by using the form of fiction short stories and their own experience. Glass acts as the perfect conduit for these ideas as glass, much like the human body, never forgets its history. Currently Rowan is utilizing their artistic practice as a declaration of self love and an act of radical self-preservation.</h2>
